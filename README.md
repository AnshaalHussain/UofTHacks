## UofT Hackathon Project

Using Google's Speech to Text Api with Text Analysis Api to identify how to improve your relationships with others!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Info

The initial purpose was to take the sentiment API and use as a tracker in order to tell how hostile your words might be when we are angry/emotional/stressed/tired, and might not think how our words can affect others. Which as we know, when we are heated that we can say things we often don't mean, and later regret, which can cause damage to those we care about. I want to combine psychology with technology, and create a mental health improvement app with a concept that I haven't seen commonly talked about in the world of web development: emotional regulation.

# Plan

The plan for this app is to allow users a place to rant or try to resolve conflicts and give themselves a chance to look over their words and identify ways to improve their communicative strategies. They can get things off their chest that they have been planning to confront someone with, and this app will tell you how hostile your tone is being, and how negative, neutral, positive your words are. Hopefully this can benefit people with their relationships, conflicts, and emotional regulation.
